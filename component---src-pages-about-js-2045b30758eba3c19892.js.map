My name is Vivi. I graduated in 2019 with a Bachelor's in Cognitive Science from UC Berkeley. Throughout my college career, I've dabbled in teaching a lot of different subjects (reading, math, science, music, and computer science!).</p>\n\n            <p>I've taken courses in computer science in undergrad and worked on Python based research projects in psychology and in education. I also taught computer science for The Coder School, which has a very open-ended learning curriculum. Teaching computer science is where I learned to debug and have fun with coding.</p>\n\n            <p>In the classroom, the teachers I worked with began to make use of new ed-tech tools that made monitoring reading progress so much easier. This was so different from the long-term research I was used to. These tools inspired me to pursue a different path in software, and led me to enrolling in the full-time software engineering bootcamp at Hackbright Academy.</p>\n\n            <p>I am currently interested in full-stack software engineering roles after my graduation from Hackbright!</p>\n            </ul>\n          </div>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  </Layout>\n)\n\nexport default AboutPage\n\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
